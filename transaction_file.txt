i would only recommend getting this camera brand new as mine has developed some problems over the years which you can prevent
camera brand new	mine	problem	year
first off i didn t know that you should never leave a battery in a camera for long periods of time it ruins your battery
first	battery	camera	long period	time
it does not ruin the camera itself i called hp tech support and talked it over with them

if you do leave the battery over a long period of time it will not be able to hold its charge

i would simply get a new battery if it wasn t for the fact that the screw on the bottom hadn t fallen out exposing the inside of the camera
